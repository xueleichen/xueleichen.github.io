# About Me
I am a Master's student in the Department of Instrument Science and Engineering at [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](http://en.sjtu.edu.cn/), advised by [Prof. Cunyue Lu](http://english.seiee.sjtu.edu.cn/english/detail/843_847.htm). Curently I am working on visual perception and inteligent control of underwater robots.

Before that, I received M.Sc in Computer Engineering at [TU Berlin](https://www.tu.berlin/en/) in 2019 through a double degree program. I conducted research in remote sensing there, advised by [Dr. Jian Kang](https://jiankang1991.github.io/) and [Prof. Begum Demir](https://www.rsim.tu-berlin.de/menue/team/prof_dr_beguem_demir/) .I received B.Sc. in Mesurement Control Technology and Instruments at [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](http://en.sjtu.edu.cn/) in 2018.

My research interests lie in the applications of machine learning in computer vision, robotics, remote sensing, etc.
