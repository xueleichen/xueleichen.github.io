# About Me
I am a Master's student in the Department of Instrument Science and Engineering at [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](http://en.sjtu.edu.cn/), advised by [Prof. Cunyue Lu](http://english.seiee.sjtu.edu.cn/english/detail/843_847.htm). Curently I am working on visual perception and inteligent control of underwater robots.

Before that, I received M.Sc in Computer Engineering at [TU Berlin](https://www.tu.berlin/en/) in 2019 through a double degree program. I conducted research there using GAN to improve remote sensing image retrieval, advised by [Prof. Begum Demir](https://www.rsim.tu-berlin.de/menue/team/prof_dr_beguem_demir/) and [Dr. Jian Kang](https://jiankang1991.github.io/). I received B.Sc. in Mesurement Control Technology and Instruments at [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](http://en.sjtu.edu.cn/) in 2018.

I also worked in [PTB Berlin](https://www.ptb.de/cms/en.html) as a student assistant for 4 months in 2019. I worked on RNN-EKF for grid state estimation and Neural network method for spectra reconstruction. My advisor was [Dr. Sascha Einchstadt](https://www.ptb.de/cms/en/ptb/ptb-management/pstab/pst-1-coordination-digitalization/pst1-the-team.html) and [Dr. Natallia Makarava](https://de.linkedin.com/in/natallia-makarava-9a445657).

I have an interdisciplinary background with knowledges about control, sensors, signal processing, and machine learning. My research interests lie in the applications of machine learning in computer vision, robotics, remote sensing, etc.
