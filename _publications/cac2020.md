## Abstract
The accurate nuclei segmentation in histopathology images is the foundational task of pathological diagnosis. Deep learning has emerged as an effective method of nuclei segmentation, but the touching nuclei are difficult to segment. In this paper, we propose a novel method for nuclei segmentation. The proposed method uses channel attention mechanism to reweight channel-wise features and further improve segmentation performance. Moreover, dilated convolution is used to aggregate multi-scale contextual information and preserve the original resolution. We name our method as Attentional Dilated Convolution Neural Network (ACDNN). Experiments on a large publicly stained tissue images dataset show the advantage of our method over other state-of-the-art methods.
