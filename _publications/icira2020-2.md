## Abstracts
This paper presents a learning-based approach for safe and socially compliant map-less navigation in dynamic environments. Our approach maps directly 2D-laser range findings and other measurements to motion commands, and a combination of imitation learning (IL) and reinforcement learning (RL) is deployed. We show that, by leveraging
prior demonstrations, the training time for RL can be largely reduced and its performance is greatly improved. We use Constrained Policy Optimization (CPO) and specially designed rewards so that a safe and socially compliant behavior is achieved. Experiment results prove that the obtained navigation policy is capable of generalizing to unseen dynamic scenarios.
